Overview
====================================

Understanding the variability in brain connectivity is essential to understanding the human brain. Currently brains are commonly modeled as a connectome by modeling brain regions as nodes and connections as edges. Currently, there is a gap between the raw data, diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) files , and actual connectomes, which can be complex and variable in development and usage.

The m2g python package, from our Johns Hopkins Open Connectome Project, is the first end to end MRI connectome estimation pipeline that can be run and has been tested in large MRI datasets. Using this package we have generated a large set of standardized connectomes () using publically available, single shell dMRI data. This large amount of connectomes is available at ___ can be directly used by researchers to utilize.
