Summary of 'Complex brain networks: graph theoretical analysis of structural and functional systems' by Bullmore2009
The paper reviews a number of investigations and researches about modeling the brain system as a complex network depending on graph theory.
Graph theory is a branch of mathematics that deals with the formal description and analysis of graphs. A graph is defined as a set of nodes linked by connections or edges. A graph provides an abstract representation of the elements and their interactions of a real-world system.
That's exactly what they apply to the brain systems, since the brain's structural and functional systems have features of complex networks like small-world topology and highly connected hubs and modularity.
Brain networks can be explored using graph theory through four steps: 1. Define the nework nodes(MRI is a kind of method to help define). 2. Estimate a continuous measure of association between nodes. 3. Generate an association matrix by compiling all pairwise associations between nodes and apply a threshold to each element of this matrix to produce a binary adjacency matrix or undirected graph. 4. Calculate the network parameters of interest in this graphical model of a  brain network and compare them to the equivalent parameters of a population of random networks. 

structural brain networks
We use annatomical Parcellations to analyze and model the structural brain networks. according to graph theory, structural brain networks can be described as graphs that are composed of nodes (vertices) denoting neural elements (neurons or brain regions) that are linked by edges representing physical connections (synapses or axonal projections).  Mapping structural networks of animal models has already been studied and currently the only nervous system to have been mapped at a cellulat resolution is the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.
