    "# Preparations of Python Implementation for FLIRT in FSL\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Flirt is the main program that performs affine registration. The main options are: an input (-in) and a reference (-ref) volume; the calculated affine transformation that registers the input to the reference which is saved as a 4x4 affine matrix (-omat); and output volume (-out) where the transform is applied to the input volume to align it with the reference volume. In addition, FLIRT can also be used to apply a saved transformation to a volume (-applyxfm, -init and -out) or to apply a transform that aligns the NIFTI mm coordinates (-applyxfm, -usesqform and -out; but not -init). For these usages the reference volume must still be specified as this sets the voxel and image dimensions of the resulting volume."

    "Cost Function Weighting\n",
    "\n",
    "Weighting volumes can be specified using -refweight, -inweight (or both). This allows the cost function to have a different weighting at each voxel, which is useful for excluding areas (weight=0) of no interest, or increasing the weighting around important structures such as the ventricles. Note that this is different from masking the original images, as masking introduces artificial boundaries whereas weighting does not.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Degrees of Freedom\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose from 6,7,9 or 12 Degrees of Freedom (DOF) for full 3D registrations. Also includes a 3DOF 2D-to-2D registration mode which is selected using the -2D option. Note that it does not perform any search in 2D mode, and cannot deal with 2D to 3D registrations. More flexible DOF options are provided by the specific schedule files provided in $FSLDIR/etc/flirtsch.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Interpolation Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "This includes Nearest Neighbour, a family of Sinc-based methods (three window types - rectangular, Hanning and Blackman) with configurable window width, and spline (a highly efficient method, with similar output characteristics to sinc). The interpolation is only used for the final transformation (and in applyxfm), not in the registration calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Cost Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "This includes the within-modality functions Least Squares and Normalised Correlation, as well as the between-modality functions Correlation Ratio (the default), Mutual Information and Normalised Mutual Information. In addition, there is the BBR cost function which utilises a segmentation of the reference image to define a boundary, and it is the intensity differences in the input image, across the transformed boundary, that contribute to the cost. \n",
